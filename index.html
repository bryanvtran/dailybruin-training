        Nine UCLA alumni joined the cast of “Frozen – Live at the Hyperion,” performing as Elsa, Olaf, Hans, Kristoff or the ensemble. The live adaptation of the 2013 Disney animated film “Frozen” currently plays three times a day at Disney California Adventure after opening in May. Each week, the Daily Bruin will share alumni’s experiences working at the Happiest Place on Earth.

      A science alumnus auditioned for the ensemble and a theater alumnus had never seen the movie. Yet both were cast as the lovable ice harvester Kristoff in “Frozen.”

      Christopher Culberson and Travis Leland are now two of six actors playing the lead male in Disney’s live musical theater version of “Frozen.” For each principal role, Disney cast six actors who rotate each performance since “Frozen – Live at the Hyperion” runs every day. Actors not only interpret their own characters, but must also react to other characters’ choices on short notice.
